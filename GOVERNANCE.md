### Documentation Working Group

The Node.js Documentation group is jointly governed by a Working Group (WG) which is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.

The WG has final authority over this project including:

* Technical direction
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators

For the current list of WG members, see the project
README.md.

### Collaborators

The Node.js Documenation WG GitHub repository is maintained by the WG and additional Collaborators who are added by the WG on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These individuals are identified by the WG and their addition as Collaborators is discussed over GitHub issues - at time of writing, these individuals are encouraged to comment on [this speific issue](https://github.com/nodejs/docs/issues/2).

Modifications of the contents of the Node.js Documentation WG repository are made on a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required participate and there is disagreement around a particular modification. See _Consensus Seeking Process_ below for further detail on the consensus model used for governance.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the WG for discussion by assigning the ***WG-agenda*** tag to a pull request or issue. The WG should serve as the final arbiter where required.

For the current list of Collaborators, see the project `README.md`.

### WG Membership

WG seats are not time-limited.  There is no fixed size of the WG. However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for WG membership beyond these rules.

The WG may add additional members to the WG by unanimous consensus.

A WG member may be removed from the WG by voluntary resignation, or by unanimous consensus of all other WG members.

Changes to WG membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be suggested as any other agenda item (see "WG Meetings" below).

No more than 1/3 of the WG members may be affiliated with the same employer.  If removal or resignation of a WG member, or a change of employment by a WG member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of the WG membership shares an employer, then the situation must be immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more WG members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).

### WG Agenda

<!-- this part needs to be rewritten. Will follow up with another commit that has those edits. -->

Each week, an issue tagged `wg-weekly` will be created. It will be a sort of weekly digest on what's happened within the docs WG. The `wg-weekly` posts will contain links and descriptions to issues tagged with `wg-agenda`. The topics links are to be discussed within their respective `wg-agenda` tagged issues, **not** in the `wg-weekly` topics.

Items are tagged with `wg-agenda` which are considered contentious or are modifications of governance, contribution policy, WG membership, or release process.

The intention of the `wg-agenda` tag is not to seek approval or review all patches proposed - that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger group of Collaborators.

Any community member or contributor can ask that issues be tagged with the `wg-agenda` tag by asking in the respective GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator, WG member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding the `wg-agenda` tag to the issue themselves.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each genda item and send it as a pull request after the meeting.

### Consensus Seeking Process

The WG follows a [Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)
decision making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a WG member can call for either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the WG or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.

Note that changes to WG membership require unanimous consensus.  See "WG Membership" above.
